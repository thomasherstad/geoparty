### Motivation
Every year before christmas, my best friends from back home and I have a christmas party. A tradition that we built throughout the years was that each person had to "host" an activity for at least 10 minutes. Because of ChatGPT's popularity in 2023 I had the idea to use it as a quiz host to come up with questions in the style of Jeopardy. I sketched up a game board on Excalidraw, wrote some prompts for different situations and we played the game that evening. It was a lot of fun! Afterwards I thought it would be cool to make this into a proper website where you could play the game automatically after setting up the categories. You wouldn't even need anyone to host it so we could all play! I wrote down a list of features I wanted to include and set my target for the 2024-edition of the Christmas party. I had just started learning to code in Python and this felt like a gigantic task for me at the time, not even knowing how http requests worked, but look at it now!
